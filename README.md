# Emotion-detection-app
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:

This project is a Text-Based Emotion Detection App that can accurately identify the emotional tone behind user-written messages. It supports multiple machine learning and deep learning models, allowing comparison of performance and accuracy.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
To detect emotions (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.) from raw text using both classic ML and modern deep learning approaches.

ðŸ§ª Models Used:
âœ… Traditional Machine Learning Models:
These models use TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words (BoW) feature extraction.

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Used for fast predictions with small datasets. Great for testing basic NLP features.

ðŸ”¥ Deep Learning Models:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Recurrent model that captures word sequence

Good for long sentences and context-sensitive emotion detection
